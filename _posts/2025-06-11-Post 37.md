**CVE ID:** [CVE-2025-45784](https://cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-45784)  
**Impact:** Information Disclosure  
**Severity:** Medium (Context-Dependent)

## Summary

A vulnerability was discovered in the firmware of the **D-Link DPH-400S and DPH-400SE VoIP phones**, allowing sensitive provisioning credentials to be exposed through **hardcoded debug logging strings**.

This issue affects firmware version `v1.01`. An attacker with access to the firmware image or device logs can extract user credentials without authentication. The vulnerability was responsibly disclosed to D-Link and has been assigned **CVE-2025-45784**.

While the affected models are **End-of-Life (EOL)**, they may still exist in legacy environments and pose an ongoing risk.

## Vulnerability Details

During static firmware analysis of the image `DPH-400S_DPH-400SE_A1_FW_v1.01.bin`, the following hardcoded strings were identified:

PROVIS_USER_PASSWORD = %s

PROVIS_ADMIN_PASSWORD = %s

These were found in the following binaries:

- `firmware/bin/tcAppPhoneProvisioning`
- `firmware/bin/tcAppPhoneLogin`
- `firmware/bin/tcGlobalTelnetCheckPassword`

The string `PROVIS_USER_PASSWORD` was located at offset `0x00441650`.

A simple `strings` command confirms their presence:

```bash
$ strings DPH-400S_DPH-400SE_A1_FW_v1.01.bin | grep PROVIS
PROVIS_USER_PASSWORD = %s
PROVIS_ADMIN_PASSWORD = %s
```

No encryption or access control protects these values, allowing easy extraction via static analysis tools such as strings, xxd, or binwalk.

**Impact**

An attacker with access to the firmware image or extracted logs can:

-    Recover valid provisioning or administrative credentials
-    Gain unauthorized access to VoIP systems or services
-    Potentially intercept or manipulate SIP-based communication sessions

This aligns with CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File.

**Attack Vector**

-    Static firmware analysis (no need for live exploitation)
-    Access to firmware image, console output, or logs
-    No authentication required

D-Link officially confirmed that the product reached End-of-Life on February 2, 2010, and will not be updated.

**Recommendations**

-    Retire or replace DPH-400S/SE devices still in use

-    Restrict access to firmware files, configuration backups, or provisioning logs

-    Isolate legacy VoIP equipment from internet-facing networks

-    Avoid reusing provisioning credentials across systems
