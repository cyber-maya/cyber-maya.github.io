**Author:** Shaunak Ganorkar, Traboda Cyberlabs Pvt. Ltd.  
**Published:** August 2025  
**CVE ID:** [CVE-2025-55583](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2025-55583)  
**Vendor:** D-Link Systems, Inc.  
**Product:** D-Link DIR-868L B1 Wireless Router  
**Firmware Affected:** FW2.05WWB02  
**Firmware SHA-256:** `545809e9851f26ea349a1681fbff4b1516b1af48d7364ac45b7016c901bdbaa8`  
**Impact:** Remote Unauthenticated Root-Level Command Execution  
**Severity:** High  
**Status:** Public

## Summary

The D-Link **DIR-868L B1** router firmware (FW2.05WWB02) contains a critical **unauthenticated command injection** vulnerability in the `fileaccess.cgi` component of its web interface.

The parameter `pre_api_arg` is passed directly to system-level functions like `system()`, `popen()`, and `execl()` **without authentication or sanitization**. This allows a remote attacker with network access to execute arbitrary commands as `root` without requiring credentials or user interaction.

## Vulnerability Details

- **Vulnerable Component:** `/dws/api/fileaccess.cgi`  
- **Parameter:** `pre_api_arg`  
- **Issue:** Unvalidated input passed directly to shell-executing functions  
- **Attack Type:** Remote (network-accessible interface)  
- **CWE IDs:**  
  - [CWE-78: OS Command Injection](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html)  
  - [CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/306.html)  
  - [CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/668.html)

## Proof of Concept (PoC)

### Static Analysis

1. Extracted firmware confirmed the presence of the `fileaccess.cgi` binary in the web root.  

2. Identified the vulnerable `pre_api_arg` parameter using static analysis tools like `strings` and `grep`.  

3. Located unsafe calls to `system()`, `popen()`, and `execl()` that accept attacker-controlled input.  

4. Cross-referenced `/dws/api/UploadFile` in frontend files, confirming that the CGI endpoint is accessible.  

5. Discovered `/bin/ash`, `sh`, and `bash` paths embedded in the binary.

## Attack Vector

- **Unauthenticated Remote Access**  
  - Exploitable on LAN by default  
  - Exploitable over WAN if remote access or port forwarding is enabled  

- **Exploit Steps**  
  1. Send a crafted HTTP request to `/dws/api/fileaccess.cgi`  
  2. Inject arbitrary commands via the `pre_api_arg` parameter  
  3. Gain root-level access on the device

---

## Impact

- Full device compromise on LAN or WAN  
- Persistent backdoors via modified startup scripts  
- Traffic interception or DNS hijacking  
- Inclusion in botnet campaigns  
- Lateral network compromise in home or enterprise setups  

---

## Severity Justification

**CVSS v3.1 Base Score:** **8.8 (High)**  
**Vector:** `AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`

The exploit is remotely accessible, requires no authentication, and grants unrestricted root-level control, making it critically dangerous.

## Recommendations

### For Users
- Disconnect vulnerable DIR-868L B1 routers from the internet immediately  
- Disable remote administration and port forwarding  
- Replace legacy hardware with models actively receiving updates  

### For Vendors
- Sanitize and validate all CGI input parameters  
- Remove direct shell invocation from web binaries  
- Drop root privileges for web-facing services  
- Deprecate or patch legacy CGI interfaces
