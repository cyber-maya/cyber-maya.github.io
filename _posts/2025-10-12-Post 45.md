**Author:** Shaunak Ganorkar, Traboda Cyberlabs Pvt. Ltd.  
**Published:** October 2025  
**CVE ID:** [CVE-2025-60855](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2025-60855)  
**Vendor:** Reolink  
**Product:** Reolink Video Doorbell Wi-Fi â€“ DB_566128M5MP_W  
**Affected Components:** `/app/upgrade`, `libmbedtls.so`, `libmbedcrypto.so`  
**Impact:** Remote Arbitrary Code Execution with Root Privileges  
**Severity:** High  
**Status:** Public  

---

## Summary

The Reolink **Video Doorbell Wi-Fi (DB_566128M5MP_W)** firmware performs **insufficient validation of firmware update signatures**.  
Attackers can upload **maliciously modified firmware images** that bypass cryptographic verification, allowing **remote code execution with root privileges**.

---

## Vulnerability Details

- **Vulnerability Type:** Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature ([CWE-347](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/347.html))  
- **Attack Type:** Remote (via malicious firmware upload)  
- **Impact:** Full compromise of device integrity and control  
- **Attack Vector:** An attacker with network or local access can deliver a crafted firmware update that bypasses validation logic due to missing signature checks in `libmbedtls.so` and `libmbedcrypto.so`.

---

## Technical Findings

1. Firmware extraction revealed `/app/upgrade` invokes cryptographic routines **without validating signatures** against a trusted keychain.  
2. The function performing the signature check does not verify the certificate chain or digest comparison, allowing unsigned firmware acceptance.  
3. Modified firmware binaries were successfully repacked with arbitrary payloads without rejection.  

---

## Impact

- Execution of attacker-supplied code as **root**  
- Permanent firmware compromise  
- Possibility of malware persistence and network pivoting  
- Undermined update trust chain  

---

## Recommendations

### For Users
- Apply only official firmware updates downloaded directly from [Reolink Download Center](https://reolink.com/download-center/).  
- Disconnect the doorbell from external networks until a fixed firmware is provided.  

### For Vendor
- Implement strong cryptographic signature validation with trusted root CA verification.  
- Enforce secure boot and reject unsigned images.  
- Audit all firmware update mechanisms for tampering prevention.
