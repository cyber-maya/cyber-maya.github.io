**Author:** Shaunak Ganorkar, Traboda Cyberlabs Pvt. Ltd.  
**Published:** October 2025  
**CVE ID:** [CVE-2025-60858](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2025-60858)  
**Vendor:** Reolink  
**Product:** Reolink Video Doorbell Wi-Fi â€“ DB_566128M5MP_W  
**Affected Components:** `/usr/sbin/ddns`, `ddnsrun.dyndns`, `ddnsrun.noip`  
**Impact:** Exposure of Sensitive DDNS Credentials  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Status:** Public  

---

## Summary

Reolink **Video Doorbell Wi-Fi (DB_566128M5MP_W)** stores and transmits **Dynamic DNS credentials in plaintext** within configuration files and scripts.  
This can lead to **credential theft, account takeover,** and **remote reconfiguration** of DNS mappings.

---

## Vulnerability Details

- **Vulnerability Type:** Insecure Permissions / Plaintext Credential Storage  
- **Attack Type:** Remote (via traffic sniffing or firmware analysis)  
- **Impact:** Information disclosure and configuration tampering  
- **Attack Vector:** Attackers monitoring network traffic or analyzing firmware can extract DDNS credentials from scripts like `ddnsrun.dyndns` and `ddnsrun.noip`.  

---

## Technical Findings

1. The DDNS configuration scripts embed plaintext usernames and passwords.  
2. No encryption or hashing mechanism is implemented for sensitive data.  
3. Network captures confirm these credentials can be transmitted unencrypted during DDNS update requests.  

---

## Impact

- Credential compromise and account hijacking  
- Unauthorized modification of DDNS entries  
- Potential redirection of device traffic or phishing infrastructure setup  

---

## Recommendations

### For Users
- Avoid using DDNS features until secure credential handling is implemented.  
- Revoke and rotate any credentials previously configured.  

### For Vendor
- Store credentials securely using encryption mechanisms.  
- Implement token-based authentication for DDNS updates.  
- Conduct a firmware-wide audit of sensitive data handling.
