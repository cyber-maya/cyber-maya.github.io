**Author:** Shaunak Ganorkar, Traboda Cyberlabs Pvt. Ltd.  
**Published:** August 2025  
**CVE ID:** [CVE-2025-55581](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2025-55581)  
**Vendor:** D-Link Systems, Inc.  
**Product:** D-Link DCS-825L Wi-Fi Baby Camera  
**Firmware Affected:** v1.08.01 and possibly prior  
**Firmware SHA-256:** `c11f4adddbea80fb173f7fbfc3d55fab6029af390e532261f659500eff42d0c6`  
**Impact:** Persistent Root-Level Code Execution  
**Severity:** High  
**Status:** Public

## Summary

The D-Link **DCS-825L** firmware v1.08.01 contains a critical flaw in the watchdog script `mydlink-watch-dog.sh`.  
This script continuously monitors and automatically restarts two binaries â€” `dcp` and `signalc`.  

Because it performs **no integrity checks, signature validation, or permission verification**, an attacker with filesystem access (via UART, firmware modification, or debug interfaces) can **replace these binaries with malicious payloads**.  

Once replaced, the watchdog script **respawns the malicious binaries with root privileges**, resulting in **persistent arbitrary code execution** even after reboots.

---

## Vulnerability Details

- **Vulnerable Script:** `/mydlink/mydlink-watch-dog.sh`  
- **Monitored Binaries:** `/mydlink/dcp`, `/mydlink/signalc`  
- **Issue:** No cryptographic or permission validation before execution  
- **Attack Type:** Local / Firmware Modification  
- **CWE IDs:**  
  - [CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/306.html)  
  - [CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/269.html)  
  - [CWE-840: Business Logic Errors](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/840.html)

## Proof of Concept (PoC)

### **Steps**
1. Extract the D-Link DCS-825L v1.08.01 firmware.  
2. Replace `/mydlink/dcp` with a custom ARM binary (benign PoC payload).  
3. Repack and deploy the firmware, or gain shell access to update the file directly.  
4. Observe that the watchdog script respawns the payload with root privileges continuously.

### **Validation**
- Using QEMU-based emulation, a benign payload was executed to create a `/tmp/poc_success` file, proving arbitrary code execution.  
- No integrity validation or sandboxing prevented the execution.

## Attack Vector

An attacker needs:
- **Local access** (physical UART/debug access) **or**
- **Firmware modification capability** (e.g., insecure update processes).

With this, they can:
- Inject a malicious payload into `dcp` or `signalc`.  
- Gain **persistent root-level control** over the camera, surviving reboots.

---

## Impact

- **Persistent compromise** of the device even after factory reset or power cycles.  
- **Botnet risk:** Vulnerable devices could be absorbed into IoT botnets.  
- **Privacy breach:** Cameras could be covertly used for surveillance.

---

## Severity Justification

**CVSS v3.1 Base Score:** **7.2 (High)**  
**Vector:** `AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L`

While the vulnerability requires local or firmware-level access, the ability to maintain persistent, privileged execution makes it critical for IoT exploitation.

---

## Recommendations

- **For users:**  
  - Immediately **disconnect or replace** unsupported DCS-825L devices.  
  - Avoid using EOL IoT devices in production or sensitive environments.

- **For vendors:**  
  - Enforce **integrity and signature checks** before respawning binaries.  
  - Implement **secure boot and code-signing** mechanisms for critical scripts.

## Vendor Response

- **June 20, 2025:** Vulnerability reported to D-Link PSIRT.  
- **June 21, 2025:** Vendor acknowledged the issue and confirmed the device is End-of-Life (EOL) and will not be patched.  
- **June 24, 2025:** Public security advisory [SAP10431](https://supportannouncement.us.dlink.com/security/publication.aspx?name=SAP10431) published.
