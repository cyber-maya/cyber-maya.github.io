**Published:** July 2025  
**CVE ID:** [CVE-2025-52363](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2025-52363)  
**Vendor:** Tenda Technology Co., Ltd.  
**Product:** Tenda CP3 Pro IP Camera  
**Firmware Affected:** V22.5.4.93  
**Firmware SHA-256:** `5120fa8f772a5a3f68a7fff83b33e54ac2035436353b64f9e7f0ec4f1695d01d`  
**Impact:** Information Disclosure  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Status:** Public

## Summary

A vulnerability was discovered in Tenda CP3 Pro Firmware V22.5.4.93, where hardcoded password hashes for the root user are stored in `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/passwd-` files within the firmware image. These files are world-readable and not protected by a shadow file, allowing offline attackers to recover the hash and potentially crack it to obtain administrative access.

---

## Vulnerability Details

- **Files Affected:** `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/passwd-`
- **Root Hash from `/etc/passwd`:** `AhpGINvJObG0U`
- **Root Hash from `/etc/passwd-`:** `ltEkcRyrDrA.o`
- **Shadow File:** Not present
- **Filesystem Path:** `jffs2-root/etc/`
- **Discovered via:** Static analysis of the extracted firmware image
- **CWE ID:** [CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html)

---

## Proof of Concept

```bash
$ cat jffs2-root/etc/passwd
root:AhpGINvJObG0U:0:0:root:/root:/bin/sh

$ cat jffs2-root/etc/passwd-
root:ltEkcRyrDrA.o:0:0:root:/root:/bin/sh
```

## Attack Vector

An attacker can download the firmware from the official vendor site or extract it from a device, then analyze the filesystem offline to retrieve the password hash. If cracked, the attacker can attempt to log in via exposed services such as Telnet or SSH.

---

## Impact

- Privilege escalation via cracked root credentials  
- Unauthorized administrative access  
- Potential full device takeover

---

## Severity Justification

**CVSS v3.1 Base Score:** **6.5 (Medium)**  
**Vector:** `AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N`

**CVSS v4.0 Base Score:** **7.0 (Medium)**  
**Vector:** `CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N`

The vulnerability requires access to the firmware image (local vector), but no privileges or user interaction. Once extracted, the attacker gains access to plaintext password hashes, representing a serious confidentiality risk and moderate integrity risk if cracked and reused.

---

## Recommendations

- Tenda should avoid embedding unsalted password hashes in production firmware  
- Device owners must change default passwords immediately  
- Disable remote services such as Telnet/SSH if not in use
