**Published:** October 2025  
**CVE ID:** [CVE-2025-60856](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2025-60856)  
**Vendor:** Reolink  
**Product:** Reolink Video Doorbell Wi-Fi â€“ DB_566128M5MP_W  
**Affected Components:** `/etc/init.d/start_app`, `/etc/passwd`, `/dev/ttyS0`  
**Impact:** Physical Root-Level Code Execution  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Status:** Public  

---

## Summary

Reolink **Video Doorbell Wi-Fi (DB_566128M5MP_W)** exposes an **unsecured UART serial console** that grants **direct root shell access** without authentication.  
This issue allows attackers with **physical access** to the hardware to gain full control of the device.

---

## Vulnerability Details

- **Vulnerability Type:** Incorrect Access Control  
- **Attack Type:** Physical  
- **Impact:** Privilege escalation to root via serial interface  
- **Attack Vector:** Connecting to UART pads during boot sequence bypasses authentication checks and spawns an unrestricted root shell.

---

## Technical Findings

1. The `/etc/init.d/start_app` script initializes services **without disabling serial access**.  
2. The `/etc/passwd` file contains **no password** for the root user.  
3. Serial logs revealed boot output accessible via `/dev/ttyS0`, providing direct access to a root shell.  

---

## Impact

- Full root-level device control via physical console  
- Firmware modification or permanent backdoor installation  
- Access to sensitive configuration data and network credentials  

---

## Recommendations

### For Users
- Prevent physical access to devices in public or shared areas.  
- If possible, epoxy or shield exposed UART pads on production units.  

### For Vendor
- Disable serial console in production firmware builds.  
- Implement secure boot and password-based shell protection.  
- Restrict maintenance interfaces to authenticated engineering modes only.
