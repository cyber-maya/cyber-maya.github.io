**Author:** Shaunak Ganorkar, Traboda Cyberlabs Pvt. Ltd.  
**Published:** August 2025  
**CVE ID:** [CVE-2025-55582](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2025-55582)  
**Vendor:** D-Link Systems, Inc.  
**Product:** D-Link DCS-825L Wi-Fi Baby Camera  
**Firmware Affected:** v1.08.01 (EU Release)  
**Firmware SHA-256:** `c11f4adddbea80fb173f7fbfc3d55fab6029af390e532261f659500eff42d0c6`  
**Impact:** Persistent Root-Level Code Execution  
**Severity:** High  
**Status:** Public

## Summary

The **D-Link DCS-825L** firmware v1.08.01 exposes a critical weakness in its **filesystem permissions**.  
Key directories containing binaries monitored by the `mydlink-watch-dog.sh` script are **writable without proper access controls**.  

An attacker with physical access, debug interface access, or the ability to modify the firmware can replace monitored binaries (such as `dcp` or `signalc`) with **malicious payloads**. These payloads are automatically executed as `root`, leading to **persistent arbitrary code execution**, even after reboots or factory resets.

---

## Vulnerability Details

- **Vulnerable Script:** `/mydlink/mydlink-watch-dog.sh`  
- **Writable Paths:** `/mydlink/` and related directories  
- **Monitored Binaries:** `/mydlink/dcp`, `/mydlink/signalc`  
- **Issue:** World-writable directories without authentication or permission enforcement  
- **Attack Type:** Local / Firmware Modification  
- **CWE IDs:**  
  - [CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/732.html)  
  - [CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/269.html)  
  - [CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/306.html)

## Proof of Concept (PoC)

### **Static Analysis**
1. Extract the official EU firmware for v1.08.01.  
2. Identify the `mydlink` directories as writable locations.  
3. Note that the watchdog script executes binaries from these directories without verifying ownership, permissions, or integrity.

---

### **Payload Injection**
1. Create a benign ARM ELF binary payload that writes a success marker file (e.g., `/tmp/poc_success`).  
2. Replace `/mydlink/dcp` with this binary in the writable partition.  
3. Upon reboot or script execution, the payload is executed with root privileges.

---

## Attack Vector

- **Physical Access:** Through UART or JTAG debug interfaces.  
- **Firmware Modification:** By unpacking and repacking the firmware image with a malicious binary.  
- **Exposed Debug Services:** If present, they could be used to write to these directories remotely.  

These methods all result in **persistent code execution** at the highest privilege level.

---

## Impact

- **Persistent compromise** of the camera, surviving reboots and resets.  
- **Botnet recruitment** for distributed attacks.  
- **Privacy violations**, enabling covert surveillance or lateral attacks in local networks.  

---

## Severity Justification

**CVSS v3.1 Base Score:** **7.2 (High)**  
**Vector:** `AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L`

Although the attack requires local or firmware-level access, the persistence and root-level privilege escalation justify a high-severity rating.

---

## Recommendations

- **For users:**  
  - Discontinue use of unsupported DCS-825L devices.  
  - Replace with supported models that implement integrity validation.  

- **For vendors:**  
  - Apply proper permission enforcement on critical directories.  
  - Implement code-signing and secure boot to prevent execution of tampered binaries.
